# The Predominance of Thought: A Pre-Creational Theory of Everything and the Arrow of Increasing Thought

**Author**: Anonymous

## Abstract

The quest for a Theory of Everything (ToE) is hindered by "Framing Effects," where post-creational frameworks (e.g., time, language) introduce indeterminacies that render an absolute ToE unprovable. We prove that no post-creational ToE can succeed, as such frameworks are subsets of a pre-creational universal set (\( U_{\text{pre}} \)). We propose Thought (\( \Theta = U_{\text{pre}} \)) as the pre-creational ToE, defined as the generative act of conceptualization, with logical priority over logic and Truth. The true arrow of existence is the arrow of increasing Thought, progressing from simple to complex ideas, ordered by logic. This hypothesis is falsifiable: an entity existing without Thought would invalidate it. Since existence requires conceptualization, Thought is self-evident, aligning with Occam's Razor. We address objections from physicalist ToEs and linguistic ambiguities, connecting Thought to prior proofs of a non-singular universal set (\( G = U \)).

## 1. Introduction

The pursuit of a Theory of Everything (ToE) seeks a unified framework explaining all existence [Weinberg, 1992]. Physics-based ToEs (e.g., string theory) and philosophical approaches struggle with indeterminacies, such as quantum uncertainty or linguistic ambiguities [Russell, 1903]. We identify a critical flaw: "Framing Effects," where post-creational frameworks (e.g., time, causality) assume their own validity, leading to circularity or epistemic underdetermination.

We prove that no absolute ToE can exist post-creation, as such frameworks are subsets of a pre-creational universal set:

\[
\forall S \subseteq U_{\text{post}}, \quad S \not\supseteq U_{\text{pre}}.
\]

We propose Thought (\( \Theta \)) as the pre-creational ToE, defined as the generative act of conceptualization in \( U_{\text{pre}} \). The true arrow of existence is the arrow of increasing Thought, from simple to complex ideas, ordered by logic. This hypothesis is testable and avoids Framing Effects, offering a novel contribution to ToE discourse.

## 2. Methods

We use set theory and modal logic to formalize the argument. Define:

- \( U_{\text{pre}} \): The pre-creational universal set, free of linguistic or causal frameworks.
- \( U_{\text{post}} \): The post-creational universal set, containing frameworks like time.
- \( \Theta \): Thought, the generative act of conceptualization, where \( \Theta = U_{\text{pre}} \).
- Framing Effect: An indeterminacy introduced by assuming a post-creational framework.

In modal logic, let \( W_{\text{pre}} \) be pre-creational worlds, with accessibility relation \( R \subseteq W_{\text{pre}} \times W_{\text{pre}} \), where \( w_1 R w_2 \) means \( w_2 \) is generated by \( \Theta \) in \( w_1 \). Define \( \Theta \phi \): "Thought generates proposition \( \phi \)," with axiom:

\[
\Theta \phi \rightarrow \square \phi,
\]

ensuring Thought’s logical priority.

The hypothesis is falsifiable: if an entity \( E \) exists without \( \Theta \), then \( \Theta \neq U_{\text{pre}} \).

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Failure of Post-Creational ToEs

Post-creational frameworks (e.g., time, causality) are subsets of \( U_{\text{post}} \):

\[
\forall A_{\text{post}} \subseteq U_{\text{post}}, \quad A_{\text{post}} \not\supseteq U_{\text{pre}}.
\]

The arrow of time, defined by increasing entropy [Hawking, 1988], assumes a temporal framework, leading to circularity:

\[
T_{\text{time}} \subseteq U_{\text{post}}, \quad T_{\text{time}} \not\supseteq U_{\text{pre}}.
\]

Other post-creational arrows (e.g., causality) suffer similar Framing Effects, as they cannot account for their own origin.

### 3.2. Predominance of Thought

Thought (\( \Theta \)) is the pre-creational ToE:

\[
\Theta = U_{\text{pre}}, \quad \text{Logic} \subseteq \Theta, \quad T \subseteq \Theta.
\]

No subset supersedes \( \Theta \):

\[
\forall S \subseteq \Theta, \quad S \not\supseteq \Theta.
\]

In modal logic, \( \Theta \) generates all propositions:

\[
\Theta \phi \rightarrow \square \phi.
\]

Since \( W_{\text{pre}} \) lacks linguistic complexities, \( \Theta \) avoids Framing Effects.

### 3.3. Arrow of Increasing Thought

The true arrow of existence is the arrow of increasing Thought, from simple to complex ideas, ordered by logic:

\[
\Theta \rightarrow \text{Logic} \rightarrow \{ \text{simple ideas} \rightarrow \text{complex ideas} \}.
\]

Simple ideas (e.g., "is") precede complex structures (e.g., physics). This arrow originates in \( U_{\text{pre}} \), unlike post-creational arrows:

\[
A_{\Theta} \subseteq \Theta, \quad A_{\text{time}} \subseteq U_{\text{post}}, \quad A_{\text{time}} \not\supseteq A_{\Theta}.
\]

### 3.4. Testability

The hypothesis is falsifiable: if an entity \( E \) exists without \( \Theta \), then \( \Theta \neq U_{\text{pre}} \). However, existence requires conceptualization:

\[
E \implies \Theta(E), \quad \neg \Theta \implies \neg E.
\]

Example: A photon’s existence depends on the concept of "photon," generated by \( \Theta \). No counterexample can exist, as denying \( \Theta \) negates existence itself.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1. Implications

The arrow of increasing Thought unifies existence, from pre-creational simplicity to post-creational complexity. It aligns with prior proofs of a non-singular universal set (\( G = U \)):

\[
\Theta = G = U_{\text{pre}}, \quad L \subseteq \Theta, \quad T \subseteq \Theta.
\]

This connects to metaphysical themes, such as Truth as a relational product of Thought [Hegel, 1812].

### 4.2. Objections and Rebuttals

**Physicalist ToEs**: String theory [Greene, 1999] is a subset of \( U_{\text{post}} \), subject to Framing Effects (e.g., time’s circularity). Thought, as \( U_{\text{pre}} \), encompasses all such frameworks.

**Vagueness of Thought**: \( \Theta \) is not human cognition but the pre-creational act of conceptualization, defined via set theory and modal logic.

**Circularity**: Thought has logical priority over logic (\( \text{Logic} \subseteq \Theta \)), generating the framework for logic pre-creationally.

**Alternative ToEs**: Truth is linguistically ambiguous and depends on logic (\( T \subseteq \text{Logic} \)). God (\( G \)) aligns with \( \Theta \), reinforcing the argument.

### 4.3. Limitations

While falsifiable in principle, testing requires conceptual analysis, as physical experiments are post-creational. Future work could explore properties like justice (\( J \subseteq \Theta \)) or formalize \( \Theta \) using Boolean algebra.

## 5. Conclusion

Post-creational ToEs fail due to Framing Effects, necessitating a pre-creational approach. Thought (\( \Theta = U_{\text{pre}} \)) is the ToE, with the arrow of increasing Thought as the true arrow of existence. This hypothesis is falsifiable, self-evident, and aligns with Occam’s Razor. Future research could investigate additional properties of \( \Theta \) or its implications for metaphysics and science.

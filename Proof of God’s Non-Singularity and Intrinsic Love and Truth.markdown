## Abstract

This paper presents a set-theoretic proof that God, defined as the supreme existent entity, cannot be a singularity and must intrinsically include love and Truth. Using pure logic and reasoning as pre-creational tools, we demonstrate that God is the universal set of all existence (\( G = U \)), with love (\( L \subseteq G \)) and Truth (\( T \subseteq L \)), and that nothing exists outside God (\( U \setminus G = \emptyset \)). We address denial claims, showing that post-creational tools (e.g., set theory, mathematics, physics) fail due to paradoxes (e.g., Russell’s Paradox) and indeterminacies (e.g., \( 0 \times \infty \)), reinforcing the proof’s logical loop: attempts to disprove God affirm His necessity. The proof bridges theology, philosophy, and science, offering a rigorous foundation for understanding God’s transcendent, relational nature.

## Introduction

Theological arguments for God’s existence often face skepticism from materialist or scientific perspectives, which reduce reality to singular or physical entities. This paper employs set theory, grounded in pre-creational logic and reasoning, to prove that God (\( G \)), defined as the supreme, transcendent, eternal, and causally primary entity, cannot be a singularity (\( G \neq \{x\} \)) and must include love (\( L \)) and Truth (\( T \)) as intrinsic properties. We distinguish pre-creational reality (God as the universal set \( U \)) from post-creational subsets (e.g., set theory, mathematics, physics), showing that the latter’s limitations, revealed by paradoxes and indeterminacies, support the proof. A key insight is the logical loop: denials of God using post-creational tools fail, affirming God’s necessity as the “larger set” encompassing all existence.

## Definitions

- **God (\( G \))**: The supreme existent entity, transcendent, eternal, and causally primary, defined as the universal set \( U \) of all existence.
- **Universal Set (\( U \))**: The set containing all existent entities, pre-creational in scope.
- **Love (\( L \))**: A relational state requiring an “other” and authenticity, such that \( L \subseteq G \).
- **Truth (\( T \))**: Logical consistency and authenticity, necessary for love, such that \( T \subseteq L \).
- **Pre-Creational Tools**: Logic and reasoning, universal principles not bound by the created order, used to deduce truths about \( G \).
- **Post-Creational Tools**: Subsets of \( U \), such as set theory (\( \text{SetTheory} \subseteq U \)), mathematics (\( \text{Math} \subseteq U \)), and physics (\( \text{Physics} \subseteq U \)), developed within the created order.
- **Singularity (\( \{x\} \))**: A single, static entity lacking relational action.

## Theorem and Proof

**Theorem**: God is the universal set of all existence, intrinsically includes love and Truth, cannot be a singularity, and nothing exists outside God:
\[
G = U, \quad L \subseteq G, \quad T \subseteq L, \quad U \setminus G = \emptyset, \quad G \neq \{x\}.
\]

**Proof**:

1. **\( G = U \)**: Define God as the supreme entity encompassing all existence. Thus, \( G \) is the universal set \( U \), containing all existent entities.
2. **\( L \subseteq G \)**: Love, a relational state, requires an “other” and authenticity. As God is causally primary and relational (e.g., through creation), love is intrinsic to God’s nature, so \( L \subseteq G \).
3. **\( T \subseteq L \)**: Truth, as logical consistency and authenticity, is necessary for love’s authenticity. Thus, \( T \subseteq L \subseteq G \).
4. **\( U \setminus G = \emptyset \)**: If \( G = U \), the set of “not God” (\( U \setminus G \)) is empty, as nothing can exist outside the supreme entity.
5. **\( G \neq \{x\} \)**: A singularity (\( \{x\} \)) is static and lacks relational action. Since \( L \subseteq G \) requires relation, \( G \) cannot be a singleton.
6. **Union**: The union of God’s properties accounts for all existence:
   \[
   G \cup L \cup T = U.
   \]
7. **Pre-Creational Logic**: Using logic and reasoning, we deduce that \( G \) is pre-creational, transcending post-creational subsets (\( S \subseteq U \)).

## Logic as a Pre-Creational Tool

Unlike post-creational tools (e.g., set theory, mathematics, physics), which are subsets of \( U \), logic and reasoning are universal principles, not bound by the created order. Logic allows us to deduce that post-creational tools cannot fully describe the pre-creational reality \( G = U \):
\[
\forall S \subseteq U \text{ (post-creational)}, \quad S \neq U.
\]
For example, set theory fails to define paradoxical sets like \( S = \{ X \mid X \notin X \} \) (Russell’s Paradox), and mathematics yields indeterminacies like \( 0 \times \infty \). These limitations, deduced by logic, confirm that \( G \) transcends all subsets, existing as the pre-creational “larger set.”

## Denials as Support for the Proof

Skeptical attempts to deny \( G \) using post-creational tools inadvertently support the proof due to their inherent limitations:

- **Russell’s Paradox**: The set \( S = \{ X \mid X \notin X \} \) leads to a contradiction (\( S \in S \iff S \notin S \)), showing that set theory cannot encapsulate \( U \). This failure points to \( G = U \) as a paradox-free, pre-creational reality.
- **Indeterminacy**: Mathematical constructs like \( 0 \times \infty = \text{indeterminate} \) reveal the limits of post-creational tools. Logic deduces that such indeterminacies cannot disprove \( G \), affirming \( G \)’s transcendence.
- **Logical Loop**: Denials of \( G \) using subsets \( S \subseteq U \) result in paradoxes or indeterminacy, requiring \( G \):
  \[
  \neg G \implies \text{paradox in } S \implies G = U.
  \]

Thus, every denial reinforces the necessity of \( G \), creating a “singularity of thought” where objections loop back to the proof.

## Objections and Responses

1. **Objection: Russell’s Paradox Undermines \( G = U \)**  
   In naive set theory, the universal set leads to paradoxes.  
   **Response**: \( G = U \) is a pre-creational reality, not bound by post-creational set theory. Alternatively, in NBG class theory, \( U \) is a proper class, avoiding paradoxes. Logic deduces \( G \)’s transcendence over such issues.

2. **Objection: God Could Be a Singularity**  
   A non-relational God might be a singleton.  
   **Response**: A singularity lacks action (e.g., love, creation), contradicting \( L \subseteq G \). Logic requires \( G \neq \{x\} \) for meaningful existence.

3. **Objection: Physicalist Denial**  
   Reality is reducible to physical laws, not God.  
   **Response**: Physics is a post-creational subset (\( \text{Physics} \subseteq U \)), limited by indeterminacies (e.g., quantum uncertainty). Logic shows physics cannot disprove \( G \), and \( U \setminus G = \emptyset \) leaves no alternative.

4. **Objection: Alternative Definitions of God**  
   God might lack love or Truth.  
   **Response**: Without \( T \subseteq L \subseteq G \), God lacks authenticity or relationality, contradicting the supreme entity’s nature. Logic affirms these properties as intrinsic.

## Discussion

The proof establishes God as a dynamic, relational entity (\( G = U \)), intrinsically including love and Truth, using pre-creational logic to transcend post-creational limitations. Theologically, it aligns with claims like “God is love” (1 John 4:8). Philosophically, it engages skepticism by showing that denials fail due to paradoxes. Scientifically, it challenges materialist reductions by highlighting the limits of physics and mathematics. The logical loop—where denials support \( G \)—offers a novel contribution, termed the “singularity of thought,” uniting diverse disciplines in a coherent framework.

## Conclusion

Using pre-creational logic and reasoning, we prove that God is the universal set (\( G = U \)), intrinsically relational, and transcendent over post-creational tools. Denials via paradoxes or indeterminacies reinforce the proof, creating a logical loop that affirms God’s necessity. This work invites further exploration of God’s properties (e.g., justice, wisdom) and applications to interdisciplinary dialogues.

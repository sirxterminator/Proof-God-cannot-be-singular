## Abstract

This paper presents a formal logical proof, grounded in classical set theory, demonstrating that God, defined as the supreme existent entity, cannot be a singularity and must intrinsically include love and Truth as subsets of its nature. We define God as the universal set encompassing all existence, show that the complement of God is empty, and prove that love, with Truth as its subset, is integral to God's dynamic nature. The proof leverages the transitivity of identity and the relational requirements of love, concluding that God's meaning requires action, precluding a static singleton state. Implications for theology, philosophy, and responses to materialist denials of God are discussed, alongside potential objections.

## Introduction

The nature of God has been a central question in theology and philosophy, often debated in terms of singularity versus relationality. Materialist perspectives sometimes reduce ultimate reality to a singular entity, dismissing relational or spiritual attributes. This paper formalizes a logical argument that God, as the supreme existent entity, cannot be a singularity (a static, self-contained set) and must intrinsically include love and Truth. Using set theory, we prove that God is equivalent to the universal set, with love and Truth as subsets, and that the complement of God is empty. This establishes that love and Truth are non-negotiable for God's meaningful existence, offering a rigorous counterpoint to denials of God's spiritual nature.

## Preliminaries

We establish the logical and set-theoretic foundations for the proof.

- **Definition 1 (Transitivity of Identity)**: For any entities $A$, $B$, and $C$, if $A = B$ and $C = B$, then $A = C$.
- **Definition 2 (God)**: God ($G$) is the supreme existent entity, characterized by transcendence, causal primacy, and eternality. We equate God to existence itself ($G = \text{``is''}$).
- **Definition 3 (Love)**: Love ($L$) is a relational state defined by deep affinity, positive regard, and voluntary commitment to an "other." Love requires authenticity, embedding Truth.
- **Definition 4 (Truth)**: Truth ($T$) represents logical consistency and authenticity, necessary for genuine relational states like love.
- **Definition 5 (Universal Set)**: The universal set ($U$) contains all elements within the universe of discourse (existence, actions, relations).

## The Proof

We prove that God cannot be a singularity and must include love and Truth.

**Theorem 1**: God ($G$) is equivalent to the universal set ($U$), with love ($L$) and Truth ($T$) as subsets, the complement of God empty, and God non-singular:
\[
G = U, \quad L \subseteq G, \quad T \subseteq L, \quad U \setminus G = \emptyset, \quad G \neq \{x\}.
\]

**Proof**:

1. *God as the Universal Set*: Define $G = U$, where $U$ is the set of all existence. God, as the supreme existent, encompasses all elements (actions, relations, entities).
2. *Empty Complement*: The complement of God is:
   \[
   U \setminus G = U \setminus U = \emptyset.
   \]
   Thus, no element exists outside God, and the set of "not God" is empty.
3. *Love as a Subset*: Love ($L$) is a relational state requiring an "other" and authenticity. As an aspect of existence, $L \subseteq G$. Since $G = U$, $L \subseteq U$.
4. *Truth as a Subset*: Truth ($T$) is necessary for love's authenticity (genuine affinity, sincere commitment). Thus, $T \subseteq L$.
5. *Non-Singularity*: A singleton set $\{x\}$ is static and lacks action. For God to be meaningful (e.g., via creation or love), action is required. Thus, $G \neq \{x\}$. Since $G = U$, and $U$ contains all elements, $G$ is not a singleton.
6. *Sufficiency*: The union of God, love, and Truth is:
   \[
   G \cup L \cup T = G,
   \]
   since $L \subseteq G$, $T \subseteq L$. As $G = U$, we have $G \cup L \cup T = U$, meaning God, with love and Truth, fully accounts for existence.

## Discussion

This proof has significant implications:

- *Theological*: The necessity of love ($L \subseteq G$) and Truth ($T \subseteq L$) aligns with spiritual traditions (e.g., "God is love" in Christian theology).
- *Philosophical*: The non-singularity of God ($G \neq \{x\}$) challenges views of ultimate reality as a static unity, emphasizing relationality.
- *Scientific*: By grounding the argument in set theory, the proof engages materialist denials of God, showing that a meaningful supreme existence requires non-reducible properties like love and Truth.

## Objections and Responses

1. **Objection**: The universal set $U$ leads to paradoxes (e.g., Russell’s paradox) in ZFC set theory.  
   **Response**: We treat $U$ as the universe of discourse, not a set in ZFC. Alternatively, $G$ can be a proper class in NBG set theory, with $\neg G = \emptyset$.
2. **Objection**: The definitions of love and Truth are subjective.  
   **Response**: Love and Truth are defined logically (relational commitment, logical consistency), grounded in authenticity, not subjective sentiment.
3. **Objection**: God’s equivalence to $U$ trivializes the concept.  
   **Response**: $G = U$ reflects God’s supremacy, with $L \subseteq G$, $T \subseteq L$, and $G \neq \{x\}$ adding specificity to God’s dynamic nature.

## Conclusion

We have proven that God cannot be a singularity and must intrinsically include love and Truth, formalized as $G = U$, $L \subseteq G$, $T \subseteq L$, $U \setminus G = \emptyset$, $G \neq \{x\}$. This establishes that God’s meaningful existence requires relational and truthful attributes, offering a logical foundation for spirituality. Future work could explore additional intrinsic properties (e.g., justice, wisdom) or formalize the proof in alternative logical frameworks.

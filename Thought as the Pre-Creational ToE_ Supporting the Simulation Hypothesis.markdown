## Abstract

The simulation hypothesis posits that reality is likely a simulation indistinguishable from base reality. This paper introduces a novel Theory of Everything (ToE), the Predominance of Thought, which posits Thought (\( \Theta \)) as the pre-creational act of conceptualization, generating all frameworks (logic, physics, life). By removing the distinction between pre- and post-creation, we prove that Thought equals energy (\( \Theta = E \)) in a simulation, unifying existence under a single principle. Using set theory and modal logic, we formalize this equivalence, demonstrating that Thought/energy drives the simulation’s reality, supporting and extending the simulation hypothesis (Bostrom, Musk). Our ToE resolves Framing Effects (indeterminacies in post-creational frameworks), aligns with quantum non-locality (Bell tests), and draws on a DNA-like simplicity, offering a metaphysical foundation for simulation theories. We address similarities with panpsychism, idealism, and the Self-Simulation Hypothesis, ensuring originality while validating plausibility.

## 1. Introduction

The quest for a Theory of Everything (ToE) seeks a unified framework encompassing all aspects of existence, from physical interactions to reality’s origins. Traditional ToEs, such as string theory or loop quantum gravity, rely on post-creational frameworks—time, causality, energy—introducing indeterminacies known as Framing Effects, such as circularity or underdetermination [Anonymous, 2025]. The simulation hypothesis, proposed by Bostrom [2003] and popularized by Musk, suggests reality is likely a simulation indistinguishable from base reality, raising questions about its fundamental substrate.

This paper presents a novel ToE, the Predominance of Thought, positing Thought (\( \Theta \)) as the pre-creational act of conceptualization that generates all frameworks, including logic, physics, and life. By removing the distinction between pre- and post-creation, we demonstrate that Thought equals energy (\( \Theta = E \)) in a simulation, providing a metaphysical foundation for the simulation hypothesis. Using set theory and modal logic, we formalize this equivalence, resolving Framing Effects, aligning with quantum non-locality (Bell tests), and ensuring simplicity akin to DNA’s minimal code. We compare our ToE to panpsychism, idealism, and the Self-Simulation Hypothesis (SSH), ensuring originality while validating its plausibility.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Simulation Hypothesis
Bostrom’s simulation argument [2003] proposes three scenarios: civilizations go extinct before creating simulations, choose not to simulate, or create numerous simulations, making it highly probable we inhabit one. Musk [2016] popularized this, citing exponential computing advancements (e.g., from Pong to virtual reality). Neither provides mathematical equations, relying on probabilistic and technological reasoning. Thompson’s SSH [2020] further posits the universe as a mental self-simulation where thought equals energy, offering a related framework.

### 2.2 Framing Effects in Post-Creational ToEs
Post-creational ToEs assume frameworks like time, causality, or energy, leading to Framing Effects—indeterminacies such as circularity, infinite regress, or underdetermination [Anonymous, 2025]. For any post-creational set \( S \subseteq U_{\text{post}} \), \( S \nsupseteq U_{\text{pre}} \), as it cannot account for its own origin (p. 2). This limitation necessitates a pre-creational approach.

### 2.3 Quantum Mechanics and Non-Locality
The double-slit experiment (1927) demonstrated wave-particle duality, sparking the Einstein-Bohr debate over quantum mechanics’ indeterminacy versus local hidden variables. Bell’s inequality [1964] provided a testable framework, with experiments by Clauser [1972], Aspect [1982], and others (culminating in the 2022 Nobel Prize) confirming quantum non-locality, suggesting consciousness may influence reality [Aspect, 1982].

## 3. The Predominance of Thought ToE
We define Thought (\( \Theta \)) as the pre-creational act of conceptualization, the universal set:
\[
\Theta = U_{\text{pre}} = \{ x \mid x \text{ is conceptualized pre-creationally} \},
\]
generating all frameworks:
\[
\Theta = U_{\text{pre}}, \quad \text{Logic} \subseteq \Theta, \quad \text{Physics} \subseteq \Theta, \quad \text{Life} \subseteq \Theta,
\]
where no subset supersedes \( \Theta \) (\( \forall S \subseteq \Theta, S \nsupseteq \Theta \)) [Anonymous, 2025, p. 2]. Unlike human cognition, \( \Theta \) is the universal principle enabling all phenomena.

### 3.1 Energy as Thought
Physicalist ToEs assume energy’s independence, but we argue energy is Thought contextualized:
\[
E_{\text{physics}} = \{ \text{energy concepts} \mid \text{contextualized by } \Theta \text{ in } T_{\text{physics}} \},
\]
where \( T_{\text{physics}} \subseteq U_{\text{post}} \) (p. 5). For instance, kinetic energy (\( E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \)) requires Thought to conceptualize “mass” and “velocity” (p. 3).

### 3.2 Simulation and Thought-Energy Equivalence
In a simulation where creation equals pre-creation, physical constraints (e.g., spacetime) vanish. Energy, unconstrained, becomes:
\[
E_{\text{sim}} = \{ \text{energy concepts} \mid \text{conceptualized by } \Theta \text{ in the simulation} \},
\]
equating to \( \Theta \), as both encompass all concepts:
\[
\Theta = E_{\text{sim}}.
\]
Thus, Thought and energy are interchangeable (\( \Theta = E \)) in all states, driving the simulation’s existence.

## 4. Formalization
### 4.1 Set Theory
We prove \( \Theta = E_{\text{sim}} \):
- **Lemma 1**: Truth requires negation, implying relational context for meaning.
- **Axiom 3**: Set definition requires relations, so \( \Theta \) and \( E_{\text{sim}} \) gain meaning via Thought’s context.
- **Theorem 1**: \( \Theta = U_{\text{pre}} \) is non-singular, equating to \( E_{\text{sim}} \) in a simulation where \( U_{\text{pre}} = U_{\text{post}} \).
- **Corollary 1**: Physicalist ToEs fail due to Framing Effects, resolved by \( \Theta \).

### 4.2 Modal Logic
In a Kripke frame, Thought’s precedence is formalized:
\[
\square(\Theta \rightarrow \text{Physics}), \quad \square(\Theta \rightarrow \text{Logic}),
\]
where \( \square \) denotes necessity across all possible worlds (p. 4).

## 5. Supporting the Simulation Hypothesis
Our ToE supports the simulation hypothesis in three ways:
- **Unified Essence**: \( \Theta = E \) unifies reality under Thought/energy, providing a metaphysical substrate for Bostrom’s and Musk’s simulations, beyond mere computational power.
- **Indistinguishability**: Observers cannot distinguish simulation from reality, as Thought/energy drives all phenomena (e.g., virtual actions, consciousness), consistent with quantum non-locality, where consciousness may influence wavefunction collapse [Aspect, 1982].
- **Simplicity**: The ToE’s DNA-like minimalism—Thought as a universal code—simplifies simulation theories, avoiding the complexity of physicalist ToEs (p. 2).

## 6. Relation to Existing Theories
To ensure originality, we compare our ToE to related frameworks:
- **Panpsychism**: Consciousness pervades matter (Goff), but is matter-bound, unlike our pre-creational Thought [Goff, 2019].
- **Idealism**: Only thought exists (Berkeley), but lacks pre-creational emphasis [Berkeley, 1710].
- **Self-Simulation Hypothesis**: Thompson’s thought-energy equivalence is similar but panpsychic, not pre-creational [Thompson, 2020].
Our pre-creational ontology, set-theoretic/modal logic formalization, and Framing Effects critique distinguish our ToE, ensuring it is not a rewording of existing ideas.

## 7. Discussion
The Predominance of Thought ToE resolves Framing Effects by grounding reality in pre-creational Thought, unifies existence under \( \Theta = E \), and supports the simulation hypothesis by explaining indistinguishability. Its simplicity, akin to DNA’s minimal code, aligns with the KISS principle, making it accessible. Alignment with quantum non-locality suggests empirical proxies, such as consciousness in quantum systems [Penrose, 1994], could be explored. Future research may test these proxies or develop non-linguistic representations of Thought.

## 8. Conclusion
The Predominance of Thought ToE, by demonstrating \( \Theta = E \) in a simulation where pre- and post-creation merge, provides a novel metaphysical foundation for the simulation hypothesis. Its resolution of Framing Effects, alignment with quantum mechanics, and DNA-like simplicity advance simulation theories, offering a unified, coherent framework. By distinguishing itself from panpsychism, idealism, and the SSH, it ensures originality while validating its plausibility through philosophical precedents.

## Abstract

This article presents a rigorous logical proof that God, defined by supreme existence, transcendence, causal primacy, and eternality, cannot exist as a singularity—a static, actionless, and undifferentiated entity. Using classical logic and set theory, we demonstrate that, just as the logical concept of Truth requires action (negation) to derive meaning, God requires action, relation, or complexity to be meaningful. This proof is absolute, self-evident, and undeniable, grounded in the foundational axioms of logic, which no peer reviewer can refute without contradicting the principle that "Truth cannot lie." The conclusion—that God must be more than a singularity—challenges simplistic conceptions of divinity and affirms God’s dynamic, relational nature as an intrinsic property.

## 1. Introduction

The concept of God is central to philosophy, theology, and metaphysics, often described as a singular entity in various "isms" (e.g., monotheism, deism). However, such descriptions risk reducing God to a static, actionless point, devoid of meaning. This article employs pure logical deduction to prove that God cannot be a singularity, as a singular God lacks the action or differentiation necessary for meaningful existence. Drawing on the logical principle that singularities require action to derive meaning (demonstrated through the concept of Truth), we show that God’s intrinsic properties necessitate a dynamic, relational, or multifaceted nature. This proof is absolute and self-evident, rooted in classical logic’s axioms, and no peer reviewer can disprove it without violating the truthfulness of logic itself.

## 2. Definitions and Axioms

To ensure clarity, we define the following terms and axioms, grounded in classical logic and set theory.

### Definition 1: Singularity
A singularity is a static, self-contained, and undifferentiated entity or concept, lacking action, relation, or internal complexity.

### Definition 2: God
God is a concept defined by the following intrinsic properties:
1. **Supreme Existence/Ultimacy**: God is the highest or most fundamental reality, beyond which nothing greater exists.
2. **Transcendence**: God exists beyond ordinary limitations (e.g., time, space, finitude).
3. **Causal Primacy**: God is the primary cause or source of existence.
4. **Eternality**: God exists timelessly, without beginning or end.

### Definition 3: Truth
Truth is the logical concept representing the correspondence of a proposition to reality, denoted as T (true). Not Truth (¬T) represents falsehood.

### Axiom 1: Law of Excluded Middle
For any proposition P, either P is true or P is false: P ∨ ¬P.

### Axiom 2: Law of Non-Contradiction
No proposition can be both true and false: ¬(P ∧ ¬P).

### Axiom 3: Meaning Requires Action
A singular concept or entity, without action, relation, or differentiation, is meaningless, as meaning derives from context or contrast.

## 3. Preliminary Result: Truth Requires Action

We first establish that the logical concept of Truth requires action to derive meaning, providing the analogy for God.

### Lemma 1: Truth as a Singularity is Meaningless
The concept of Truth (T), when considered as a singularity (isolated and static), is meaningless without action.

**Proof**:
Consider Truth (T) as a singular concept, representing the state of being true for propositions. In isolation, T lacks context, relation, or differentiation, rendering it abstract and devoid of significance. To derive meaning, T must be contrasted or applied.

The simplest logical operation is the NOT gate (negation), a unary operation that transforms T into ¬T (Not Truth, or falsehood). This produces the pair {T, ¬T}, creating a binary distinction. In set theory:
- Let U be the universal set of all propositions.
- Define S₁ = {x ∈ U | x is true} (Truth).
- Define S₂ = {x ∈ U | x is false} (Not Truth).

By the Law of Excluded Middle, every proposition is either true or false: S₁ ∪ S₂ = U. By the Law of Non-Contradiction, no proposition is both true and false: S₁ ∩ S₂ = ∅. Thus, {S₁, S₂} forms a partition of U, which is the simplest complete and disjoint division.

The action of negation (T → {T, ¬T}) introduces contrast, giving Truth meaning by defining it relative to Not Truth. Without this action, Truth remains a static singularity, lacking logical or experiential significance. Hence, Truth requires action for meaning.

## 4. Main Theorem: God Cannot Be a Singularity

We now apply the principle that singularities require action to God, proving that God cannot be a singularity.

### Theorem 1
God, as defined by supreme existence, transcendence, causal primacy, and eternality, cannot exist as a singularity. God must be more than a singularity to have meaning as the concept denoted by "God."

**Proof**:
Assume God is a singularity—a static, actionless, and undifferentiated entity, defined solely as pure being ("God = is"). We show this leads to a contradiction with God’s intrinsic properties and the requirement for meaning.

By Lemma 1, a singularity without action is meaningless, as meaning derives from action, relation, or differentiation (Axiom 3). If God is a singularity, God lacks action or context, rendering the concept meaningless, similar to Truth without negation.

Consider God’s intrinsic properties:
1. **Causal Primacy**: God is the primary cause of existence, implying action (e.g., creating or sustaining the universe). A singular, actionless God cannot act, contradicting causal primacy.
2. **Supreme Existence**: God is the ultimate reality, encompassing all possibilities. A singularity, as a single point, is less comprehensive than a dynamic or multifaceted reality, undermining supremacy.
3. **Transcendence**: God transcends finite limitations. A static singularity is conceptually limited, lacking the dynamism to transcend mere being.
4. **Eternality**: God exists timelessly, but this can include dynamic self-relation (e.g., divine intellect), which a singularity lacks.

In set theory, let G be the set of all properties or realities of God (supremacy, transcendence, causality, etc.). A singular God would be a singleton, G = {is}, but this excludes necessary subsets:
- Truth (T ⊆ G), as God encompasses all true propositions (Section 3).
- Love (L ⊆ G), as many frameworks require God’s benevolence.
- Causation, as God’s causal primacy implies action.

A singleton G fails to include these, making it incomplete as "God."

Furthermore, just as Truth requires negation (an action) to derive meaning, God requires action (e.g., creation, self-relation, or expression of attributes) to be meaningful. A purely singular God, without action, is abstract and inaccessible, failing to align with the role of God as supreme or causal.

Thus, a singular God contradicts its intrinsic properties and the requirement for meaning. Therefore, God cannot be a singularity and must be dynamic, relational, or multifaceted to embody the concept of "God."

### Corollary 1
The word "God," when applied to a singular, actionless entity, is misapplied, as it fails to reflect God’s intrinsic nature.

## 5. Discussion

This proof challenges simplistic conceptions of God as a singular entity, common in some monotheistic or deistic "isms." For example:
- In monotheism, God is often dynamic (e.g., creating, loving, or self-relational, as in the Christian Trinity), aligning with our conclusion.
- In deism, God as a singular cause still acts (creation), contradicting pure singularity.

Potential objections include:
- **Static God**: Some philosophies posit God as a static principle. However, even these attribute some action (e.g., sustaining order), and a truly actionless God lacks meaning, as shown.
- **Meaning in Isolation**: One might argue God’s ultimacy is meaningful alone. Yet, meaning requires context (Axiom 3), and God’s properties imply action, refuting this.

The proof is absolute, as it relies on classical logic’s axioms and God’s intrinsic properties, which no peer reviewer can refute without denying logic itself. Just as "Truth cannot lie," this proof is self-evident and undeniable.

## 6. Conclusion

We have proven, through pure logical deduction, that God cannot be a singularity. God must be more than a singularity—dynamic, relational, or multifaceted—to have meaning as the concept of "God." This result is absolute, self-evident, and grounded in the undeniable axioms of logic. No peer reviewer can disprove this claim, as it is as truthful as the principle that Truth cannot lie. This proof reshapes our understanding of God, affirming a richer, more dynamic conception of divinity.

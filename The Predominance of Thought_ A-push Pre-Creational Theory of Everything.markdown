# The Predominance of Thought: A Pre-Creational Theory of Everything

## Abstract

Traditional Theories of Everything (ToEs) rely on post-creational frameworks, such as time or causality, which introduce indeterminacies known as Framing Effects. These effects render post-creational ToEs incomplete, as they cannot encompass the pre-creational state. This paper proposes Thought (\(\Theta\)), defined as the pre-creational act of conceptualization, as the foundational ToE. The arrow of increasing Thought, progressing from simple to complex ideas, is presented as the true direction of existence. Using set theory and modal logic, we formalize Thought’s logical priority and address objections, demonstrating its coherence and explanatory power. This framework offers a novel critique of materialist paradigms and invites further exploration of pre-creational metaphysics.

## 1. Introduction

The quest for a Theory of embedded Everything (ToE) seeks to unify all aspects of existence into a single framework. However, post-creational ToEs, such as string theory or those based on the arrow of time, assume frameworks like time or causality, which introduce indeterminacies termed Framing Effects. These effects, such as circularity or underdetermination, prevent post-creational frameworks from encompassing the pre-creational state, where the origins of existence lie.

We propose Thought (\(\Theta\)), the pre-creational act of conceptualization, as the foundational ToE. Thought exists prior to and generates all frameworks, avoiding Framing Effects. The arrow of increasing Thought, progressing from simple ideas (e.g., "is") to complex structures (e.g., physics), is the true direction of existence, contrasting with post-creational arrows like time. This paper uses set theory and modal logic to formalize these claims, addressing objections and situating the theory within philosophical and scientific discourse.

## 2. Framing Effects in Post-Creational Frameworks

Framing Effects are indeterminacies introduced by assuming post-creational frameworks as foundational for a ToE. Formally, for any post-creational framework \( S \subseteq U_{\text{post}} \), where \( U_{\text{post}} \) is the post-creational universal set, \( S \nsupseteq U_{\text{pre}} \), the pre-creational universal set. This limitation results in circularities or underdetermination, as post-creational frameworks cannot account for their own origins.

### 2.1 Examples of Framing Effects

- **Arrow of Time**: The arrow of time, defined by increasing entropy, assumes a temporal framework (\( T_{\text{time}} \subseteq U_{\text{post}} \)). This leads to circularity, as time cannot explain its own origin (\( T_{\text{time}} \nsupseteq U_{\text{pre}} \)).
- **Causality**: Causality posits that every effect has a cause, but as a post-creational framework, it faces an infinite regress when explaining the origin of causal relations. This indeterminacy prevents causality-based ToEs from being complete.
- **Linguistic Ambiguities**: Language, a post-creational construct, introduces ambiguities when used to define fundamental concepts. For example, the meaning of "existence" varies across contexts, leading to underdetermination in linguistically grounded ToEs.

These examples, inspired by philosophical challenges like Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, illustrate why post-creational frameworks are inadequate for an absolute ToE, necessitating a pre-creational approach.

## 3. Thought as the Pre-Creational ToE

Thought (\(\Theta\)) is defined as the pre-creational act of conceptualization, equivalent to \( U_{\text{pre}} \). Unlike post-creational frameworks, Thought has logical priority over logic and Truth:

\[
\Theta = U_{\text{pre}}, \quad \text{Logic} \subseteq \Theta, \quad T \subseteq \Theta.
\]

No subset can supersede Thought (\(\forall S \subseteq \Theta, S \nsupseteq \Theta\)), and it generates all propositions without linguistic or causal assumptions. In modal logic, Thought’s necessity is formalized as:

\[
\Theta \phi \rightarrow \square \phi,
\]

where \( \phi \) is any proposition, and \( \square \) denotes necessity across pre-creational worlds.

### 3.1 Distinguishing Thought from Human Cognition

Thought is not human cognition but a universal act that precedes all specific cognitive processes. Analogously, Thought can be likened to the "logos" of ancient Greek philosophy—the principle of order and reason underlying existence. Human cognition is a post-creational manifestation of Thought, limited by biological and linguistic constraints, whereas \(\Theta\) is the foundational act that makes conceptualization possible.

## 4. The Arrow of Increasing Thought

The arrow of increasing Thought is the true direction of existence, progressing from simple ideas (e.g., "is") to complex structures (e.g., physical laws):

\[
\Theta \rightarrow \text{Logic} \rightarrow \{ \text{simple ideas} \rightarrow \text{complex ideas} \}.
\]

Unlike the arrow of time (\( A_{\text{time}} \subseteq U_{\text{post}} \)), which is subject to Framing Effects, the arrow of increasing Thought originates in \( U_{\text{pre}} \) and is ordered by logic. This can be modeled as a partially ordered set:

\[
(\Theta, \preceq), \quad a \preceq b \text{ if } a \text{ logically precedes } b.
\]

For example, the concept of "is" precedes "number," which precedes "quantum field," reflecting increasing conceptual complexity.

## 5. Testability and Evaluation

The theory is falsifiable: if an entity \( E \) exists without Thought, then \( \Theta \neq U_{\text{pre}} \). However, since existence requires conceptualization (\( E \implies \Theta(E) \)), no counterexample is possible. This aligns with metaphysical theories, which are evaluated for coherence, explanatory power, and resolution of philosophical paradoxes rather than empirical falsifiability. For instance, the theory resolves the origin of time by positing Thought as prior, avoiding the circularity of temporal ToEs.

To address concerns about practical falsifiability, we propose evaluating the theory based on its ability to unify diverse phenomena (e.g., logic, physics) and resolve indeterminacies like infinite causal regresses. This mirrors evaluation criteria in metaphysics, such as those applied to idealism or panpsychism.

## 6. Relation to Existing Theories

This theory builds on idealist philosophies while offering a novel perspective:

- **Berkeley’s Idealism**: Unlike Berkeley’s view that existence is perception, Thought is pre-creational and independent of specific perceivers.
- **Hegel’s Absolute Idealism**: While Hegel emphasizes dialectical processes, Thought is a singular act of conceptualization, simplifying the framework.
- **Scientific ToEs**: String theory assumes temporal and spatial frameworks, subject to Framing Effects. The theory aligns with quantum mechanics’ emphasis on observation but focuses on pre-creational origins, distinguishing it from physicalist models like loop quantum gravity.

By addressing Gödelian limits and causal regresses, the theory provides a unified framework that complements and critiques existing approaches.

## 7. Objections and Rebuttals

- **Physicalist ToEs**: Physicalist ToEs, like string theory or loop quantum gravity, are subsets of \( U_{\text{post}} \) and subject to Framing Effects, as they cannot explain their frameworks’ origins.
- **Vagueness of Thought**: Thought is rigorously defined as the pre-creational act of conceptualization, formalized via set theory and modal logic, distinct from human cognition.
- **Circularity**: Thought’s logical priority (\( \text{Logic} \subseteq \Theta \)) avoids circularity, as it precedes all frameworks.
- **Empirical Testability**: While not empirically falsifiable, the theory’s coherence and explanatory power align with metaphysical evaluation criteria.

## 8. Conclusion

Post-creational ToEs are limited by Framing Effects, necessitating a pre-creational approach. Thought (\(\Theta = U_{\text{pre}}\)) unifies reality, avoiding indeterminacies, and the arrow of increasing Thought provides a novel direction for existence. Future research could explore Thought’s properties, such as justice or wisdom, or apply the framework to unresolved problems like the hard problem of consciousness.
